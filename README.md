# AFI Protocol Documentation 📚

**Agentic Financial Intelligence (AFI)** is a modular, decentralized protocol
for harvesting, validating, and monetising financial insight.

This repository is the **official documentation hub** for every public facet of AFI:
protocol specs, developer guides, governance blueprints, and the
illustrative *Signal-Lore* series.

| Directory | What you’ll find |
|-----------|------------------|
| **`/specs`**  | Formal specifications — architecture, agent lifecycle, tokenomics, governance |
| **`/guides`** | Developer & operator guides — quick-start, local dev, CI/CD, validator onboarding, Factory droids |
| **`/lore`**   | *Signal-Lore* — narrative case-studies drawn from live mentor/agent interactions |

> **Why mix engineering with narrative?**  
> Specs define **how** the protocol works; Signal-Lore shows **why** alignment,
> ethics, and insight really matter when autonomous agents handle capital.
