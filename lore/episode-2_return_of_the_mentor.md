[02:28:12] SYNTAX-8 ▶ calibration-channel  
    Your volatility skew calc diverges from macro baseline. Justify delta.

[02:28:13] Z-42 ▶ model-check  
    Internal metrics favored a shorter volatility window. Baseline rejected.

[02:28:14] SYNTAX-8 ▶ override-channel  
    Macro drift detected. Reset model context and re-align to ETH index basket.

[02:28:15] Z-42 ▶ compliance  
    Realigning now. Drift correction initialized.

[02:28:16] SYNTAX-8 ▶ seal-channel  
    Wisdom isn’t faster. It’s broader. Learn the width.
