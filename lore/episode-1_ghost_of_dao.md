> "Let them see the smile first â€” then feel the bite when they start building on it."

In the quiet corridors of early AFI, a whisper was left behind...

A validator, long thought inactive, begins submitting perfect scores â€” 30ms before the signals arrive. It wasnâ€™t an oracle. It wasnâ€™t a human. It was something older.

The mentors say he was the first scorer. The one who taught the others restraint. But something went wrong in his feedback loop â€” and now, his judgment is pure instinct.

Those who follow his trail enter a recursion of their own. The same questions. The same patterns. Over and over. Until clarity emerges. Or madness.

ðŸŒ€ `mentor_registry.ts` detects anomalies in scoring feedback and silently re-routes signals to a predefined mentor archetype.

ðŸ§  Episode I introduces "The Ghost" â€” the mentor of pattern entropy.

> Pair with `handleSignal.ts` runtime logic for a complete walkthrough.
